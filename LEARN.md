## 1. Frontend Development and Design ![#](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0000FF/000000?text=+) **(Blue)**

This category focuses on the development of the frontend of a website or application, which involves creating the visual design and user interactions.

### Design and User Experience (UX/UI)

This subcategory is about the process of designing the interface and ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. It involves creating wireframes, mockups, and ensuring that the design meets accessibility standards.

- **Pipelines (J)**: Workflow or process pipelines to streamline design and development.
- **Wireframes (J)**: Basic layout sketches showing the structure of web pages.
- **Mockups (J)**: High-fidelity designs that illustrate the final look and feel of a page.
- **Call-to-actions (CTA) (M)**: Elements in the UI designed to prompt users to take action.
- **Glow effect (M)**: Visual effects used to highlight elements in the design.
- **Contrast checker (J)**: A tool to ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for readability.
- **Usability (M)**: Ensuring the product is easy to use and navigate.
- **Accessibility (S)**: Making designs usable by people with disabilities.
- **Responsive design (M)**: Ensuring that the design works on all screen sizes.
- **Dark/Light mode (M)**: Providing users with the option to toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Focus and tab index management (S)**: Techniques to manage keyboard navigation efficiently.
- **Color blindness simulation testing (M)**: Testing designs to ensure color accessibility for users with color blindness.
- **Screen reader accessibility optimization (S)**: Making designs compatible with screen readers for visually impaired users.
- **WCAG for complex UI (S)**: Ensuring that the design complies with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for complex interfaces.
- **Visual accessibility testing (M)**: Verifying that the design is visually accessible for all users.
- **Pseudo-elements for visual accessibility (M)**: Using CSS pseudo-elements to enhance visual accessibility.

### Frontend Technologies

This section includes the key frontend technologies used to build the user interface.

- **HTML5 (J)**: The standard language for creating and structuring web content.
- **CSS3 (J)**: The styling language used to design the visual appearance of web pages.
- **JavaScript (J)**: The programming language that powers interactivity in web pages.
- **TypeScript (M)**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to enhance code quality and maintainability.
- **React (M)**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.
- **Tailwind CSS (M)**: A utility-first CSS framework that speeds up the development of custom designs.
- **Framer Motion (M)**: A library for animations and transitions in React applications.
- **WebAssembly (S)**: A binary format for high-performance execution on web browsers.
- **SVG (M)**: Scalable Vector Graphics for displaying vector-based images.
- **Advanced vector graphics (S)**: High-quality vector graphics for intricate designs and animations.
- **Advanced layout creation with Tailwind CSS (M)**: Techniques for building complex layouts with Tailwind.
- **Design systems with Tailwind (M)**: Creating consistent and reusable UI components with Tailwind CSS.
- **SVG animations with JavaScript and CSS (S)**: Creating interactive and animated SVG elements using JavaScript and CSS.

### Performance Optimization

This subcategory focuses on improving the performance and efficiency of a website or application.

- **Lazy loading (M)**: Loading resources only when they are needed, improving page load speed.
- **Bundle size reduction (M)**: Reducing the size of JavaScript bundles to enhance performance.
- **Code splitting (S)**: Breaking the code into smaller chunks to optimize load times.
- **Responsive images (M)**: Serving different image sizes based on the user's device.
- **Image compression (M)**: Reducing the size of images without sacrificing quality.
- **Performance optimization (S)**: General strategies for improving website performance.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) (S)**: Creating web apps that behave like native mobile apps.
- **CDN (M)**: Using Content Delivery Networks to reduce latency and load times.
- **Performance SEO (S)**: Optimizing performance factors that impact SEO, like Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).
- **Core Web Vitals strategies (S)**: Strategies for improving Core Web Vitals metrics.
- **Reducing interactive animation latency (S)**: Making animations more responsive.
- **GPU-friendly CSS animation properties (M)**: Using CSS properties that leverage GPU acceleration for smoother animations.
- **Complex animation techniques with Framer Motion (S)**: Handling advanced animations in React with Framer Motion.

### Testing and Code Quality

Ensuring the code is robust, tested, and of high quality is essential in this subcategory.

- **Automated testing (S)**: Writing tests that run automatically to ensure code works as expected.
- **A/B testing (M)**: Testing different versions of a page to see which one performs better.
- **BrowserStack (M)**: A tool for testing websites across multiple browsers.
- **Refactoring (M)**: Improving the structure of existing code without changing its functionality.
- **Color blindness simulation (M)**: Testing the site with color blindness simulations to ensure accessibility.
- **End-to-End Testing (E2E) (S)**: Testing the application from the user's perspective, ensuring the entire workflow works correctly.
- **Integration Testing (S)**: Testing interactions between components or systems to ensure they work together.
- **Unit testing (M)**: Testing individual components or functions.
- **Mocking (M)**: Using mock objects to simulate dependencies during tests.
- **Snapshot testing (M)**: Ensuring that the UI does not unexpectedly change.
- **Test coverage (M)**: Ensuring that all parts of the application are covered by tests.
- **Performance and accessibility testing (S)**: Verifying that the application is both performant and accessible.
- **Contract testing (S)**: Testing communication between services to ensure they adhere to the contract.
- **Property-Based Testing (S)**: Testing with a range of input data to ensure robustness.
- **Test automation (S)**: Implementing systems that run tests automatically to catch issues early.
